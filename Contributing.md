# Intro...
First of all. I am super excited to be working on this project with such a dedicated team. This is gonna be so exciting!!! 💃 💃 
No matter what happens. Let's remember to have fun, learn and help each other out. 🦸‍♂️ 🦸‍♀️

First of all, all I am writing is just a proposal, if you have a better way of working, kindly raise it with us and we will refine the process. 

## Contributing
For the benefit of avoiding the constant merge conflicts and ensuring we keep learning from each other and foster togetherness, let's uplhold the following:
1. Getting started, look for tasks issued to you [here](https://github.com/GrishonNganga/Wazzy/projects/1). If there are none, view issues not assigned [here](https://github.com/GrishonNganga/Wazzy/issues) and assign it to yourself.
2. Move the issue you want to work on from TODO column to In Progress in the [project tab column](https://github.com/GrishonNganga/Wazzy/projects/1)
3. Create a new branch where you will work on that feature without affecting anyone else's work.
4. Once you are done with a feature, request a code review from any other teammate. This gives you a second eye on what you did. Also keeps us in sync with what other people are doing, not working in silos.
5. Everything is okay? Then merge it on dev branch. (Not the main branch) Let's leave it for finished features.

## Conclusion
I know all these might seem like overkill for a hackerthon project. I hear you. But being organized enables us to move way faster without affecting each others work.

Any contributions to this doc will be highly appreciated.
