# Intro...
First of all. I am super excited to be working on this project with such a dedicated team. This is gonna be so exciting!!! 💃 💃 
No matter what happens. Let's remember to have fun, learn and help each other out. 🦸‍♂️ 🦸‍♀️

Kindly note, all I am writing is just a proposal, if you have a better way of working, kindly raise it with us and we will refine the process. 

## Contributing
For the benefit of avoiding the constant merge conflicts and ensuring we keep learning from each other and foster togetherness, let's uphold the following:
1. Getting started, look for tasks issued to you [here](https://github.com/GrishonNganga/Wazzy/projects/1). If there are none, view issues not assigned [here](https://github.com/GrishonNganga/Wazzy/issues) and assign it to yourself.
2. Move the issue you want to work on from **TODO** column to **In Progress** in the [project tab](https://github.com/GrishonNganga/Wazzy/projects/1)
3. Create a new branch where you will work on that feature without affecting anyone else's work.
4. Once you are done with the feature, create a **pull request** from your branch to the **dev branch** and request a code review from any other teammate. This gives you a second eye on what you did. Also keeps us in sync with what other people are doing, not working in silos.
5. Everything is okay and approved by your reviewer? Then merge pull request.

## Conclusion
I know all these might seem like overkill for a hackerthon project. I hear you. But being organized enables us to move way faster without affecting each others work.

Any contributions to this doc will be highly appreciated.
